    <h3>
   <p>Welcome all,</p>
   <p>I am Vivaan V Tayur. This is my YouTube channel VivaanTayur Tech. </p>
   <p>This is the YouTube channel description-</p>

  </h3> 
   <p><i>&ldquo;Vivaan is a kid who is extremely interested in electrical, electronic and programming experiments. He does all the connections from scratch but everything is done under adult supervision. The cutting work is done by adults at almost all times but the whole circuit is done by him &rdquo;</i></p>
   
  <h3> 
   <p>My YouTube channel was started in 17 May 2018, with the first video as Wireless driller. I was still 6 years old! </p>
   <p>I liked electronics a lot when I was just 6 years old. I used to se a lot of videos on electronics such as simple circuits in YouTube. These videos inspired me to make my own YouTube channel. We made a YouTube channel and named it "Vivaan Tech". But many other users were using the name. So we came up with an idea - "VivaanTayur Tech"!!!</p>
   <p>I wanted to focus the channel only on electronics. But I had interest in programming too, when I was 9 years old. That was when I started making videos about Scratch. I also have made videos about HTML. I plan to do videos on other programming softwares too, such as Logo(MSWLogo). I also do videos on Arduino, the programmable PCB board. I also make some simple and complex circuits and give simple explanations to all of these.</p>
   <p>The logo of my channel is designed by my school friend, Shrikar. </p>
   <p></p>
